Project Title: 
Exploring State-Of-The-Art Language Models for Speech Recognition in TED-LIUM 3

Project Summary: 
Language modeling plays a crucial role in the task of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In traditional ASR systems, language models (LMs) are used along with acoustic and pronunciation models in calculating the conditional probability of a set of words, given the audio input features. In end-to-end ASR systems, which use neural network architectures to model input audio directly to transcribed text, LMs may be used externally by combining results or modeled internally within the architecture. Numerous comparative studies have shown that an ASR system utilizing a language model has a lower Word Error Rate (WER) than one without it. Additionally, lowering the overall perplexity of the language model appears to also reduce the WER of an ASR system using the language model. In this project, I propose to study the problem of improving the TED-LIUM (release 3) ASR models by enhancing the underlying language model. While doing so, I plan to analyze results with WER and computational efficiency, noting any trade-offs, and compare the effects on the ASR system against various classes of LMs and decoding strategies.[TO BE COMPLETE!]
